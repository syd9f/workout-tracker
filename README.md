# Project 2 - LiftLog

https://workout-tracker-project-2-ll.herokuapp.com/login

## Description

Our motivation for the development of this application was to create a product that allows a user to easily schedule and track their workouts to achieve their personal health and fitness goals. 

This application allows a user to track their exercises via an easy to use interface with features such as the ability to schedule a workout for their desired date and time,
select an exercise to create their custom workout from a list of exercises, and
set goals and track achievements to keep themselves accountable and motivated. 

We used the following user story during development: 
AS A user that wants to focus on my physical health, I WANT to be able to easily schedule and track my workouts, SO THAT I can stay motivated and organized during my fitness journey.

Our focus for this project was to create an application that allows us to practice all the skills we've learned so far to be full-stack web developers. 

Through working on this project and building out this application, we were able to fine tune our collaboration skills, while using tools such as GitHub, Node.js, Express.js, MYSQL, and more, to create a responsive and user friendly application.

After logging in, you are then taken to the homepage of the website, which contains a 'Schedule Exercise' section, an 'Accomplishments' section and a 'Goals' section.

You can schedule an exercise by clicking on the "Add to schedule" button, where you'll then be prompted to enter a date, time and duration and then select a workout from the list of exercises.

Once a workout has been scheduled it'll appear below the "Add to schedule" button and once you've completed this workout, you can mark it as completed. You also have the option to use the Goals feature which allows you to set a goal and once you've completed your goal, you can mark it as completed and it'll render in the 'Accomplishments' section.
